## Author Notes
The code is pretty spaghetti since I wrote all of this in a day and I haven't bothered to check or fix any possible problems, although on the bright side it could be worse. As a heads up, I have no idea how good the Flexbox code is, since I figured out how Flexbox works after I finished building this.

The whole color scheme changes with the seasons (or really, more like the months), and I'm pretty proud of how that turned out! A possible change would be color transition between the seasons so it's actually accurate.

I actually use this every day, and it's really helpful for organization, since I can customize it to my heart's content. Maybe I'll write a new one in the future when I have time again!

[Bryant Park](https://github.com/bryantpark04) came up with this [ingenious idea](https://github.com/bryantpark04/new-tab-page-tutorial), and it's been rewritten multiple times for fun. All designs are by Anna Hsu, and the code has been heavily modified from Bryant's original vision. If you'd like, feel free to clone your own version and edit to your heart's content.
