# New Tab Page

New tab page & Github Pages project demo, originally for TJ Dev Club!

## Usage

For actual use, install the [New Tab Redirect](https://github.com/jimschubert/newtab-redirect) Chrome extension, and follow any directions that are given.

## Author Notes

I said I would write a new one in the feature, and a new one has been written now!

## Credits

[Bryant Park](https://github.com/bryantpark04) came up with this [ingenious idea](https://github.com/bryantpark04/new-tab-page-tutorial), and it's been rewritten multiple times for fun. All designs are by Anna Hsu, and the code has been heavily modified from Bryant's original vision. If you'd like, feel free to clone your own version and edit to your heart's content.
